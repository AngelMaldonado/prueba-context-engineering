## Fundamental Principles of Boxing

### The Four Basic Punches

#### 1. The Jab

The jab is the most important punch in boxing - a quick, straight punch thrown with the lead hand.

**Technique:**

- Extend lead hand directly from guard position
- Rotate fist so palm faces down at impact
- Keep rear hand protecting chin
- Snap the punch back to guard immediately
- Maintain stance and balance throughout

**Purpose:**

- Establish distance and control range
- Set up combinations
- Disrupt opponent's rhythm
- Score points while minimizing risk

**Training Focus:**

- Practice 100+ jabs daily for muscle memory
- Focus on speed over power initially
- Work on accuracy before increasing intensity

---

#### 2. The Cross (Straight Right/Left)

A powerful straight punch thrown with the rear hand, generating maximum force through hip rotation.

**Technique:**

- Rotate rear hip forward explosively
- Drive off back foot, transferring weight forward
- Extend rear hand in straight line to target
- Rotate fist palm-down at full extension
- Keep lead hand protecting chin
- Return to guard position immediately

**Purpose:**

- Primary power punch
- Counter-punching weapon
- Knockout potential

**Training Progression:**

- Beginners: Focus on rotation and weight transfer
- Intermediate: Develop timing and power
- Advanced: Master feinting and combination work

---

#### 3. The Hook

A circular punch targeting the sides of the head or body, delivered in a semi-circular motion.

**Technique:**

- Keep elbow at 90-degree angle
- Turn front foot and hip simultaneously
- Swing arm in horizontal arc
- Keep opposite hand protecting face
- Maintain compact motion (don't "wind up")
- Return to guard position

**Variations:**

- Lead hook: Quick, setup punch
- Rear hook: More power, usually follows straight punches
- Body hook: Target ribs and liver area

**Common Mistakes:**

- Dropping hands before throwing
- Excessive wind-up (telegraphing)
- Poor balance and overextension
- Neglecting to return to guard

---

#### 4. The Uppercut

A vertical punch delivered from below, traveling upward to chin or body.

**Technique:**

- Drop shoulder slightly without telegraphing
- Drive upward through legs and hips
- Keep elbow tight to body
- Punch travels vertical path
- Rotate fist palm-facing-self at impact
- Immediately return to guard

**Application:**

- Effective in close range
- Counter to opponent's forward pressure
- Target chin or solar plexus

**Safety Note:**

- Requires good timing and distance judgment
- Practice with coach supervision initially
- Easy to lose balance if mistimed
