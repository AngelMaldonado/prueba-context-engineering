## About CrossFit Official Training

CrossFit is a registered trademark and methodology developed by CrossFit, Inc. The official training guides represent the authoritative source for CrossFit methodology, encompassing constantly varied functional movements executed at high intensity across broad time and modal domains. This document is based on the official Level 1 and Level 2 Training Guides used for coach certification worldwide.

## Core Methodology and Philosophy

### Definition of CrossFit Fitness

CrossFit defines fitness as "increased work capacity across broad time and modal domains." This means developing capacity to perform well in:

**Three Metabolic Pathways:**

1. **Phosphagen** (0-10 seconds) - Immediate energy, high power
2. **Glycolytic** (30 seconds - 2 minutes) - Lactate threshold work
3. **Oxidative** (2+ minutes) - Aerobic endurance

**Ten General Physical Skills:**

1. Cardiovascular/Respiratory Endurance
2. Stamina
3. Strength
4. Flexibility
5. Power
6. Speed
7. Coordination
8. Agility
9. Balance
10. Accuracy

**Training Philosophy:**

- "Constantly varied" - No predictable routine
- "Functional movements" - Natural, multi-joint movements
- "High intensity" - Relative to individual capacity

---

## The Nine Foundational Movements

### Lower Body Movements

#### 1. Air Squat

The foundation of all squatting movements.

**Mechanics:**

- Feet shoulder-width apart, toes slightly out
- Weight in heels, midfoot
- Descend by pushing hips back and down
- Keep chest up, neutral spine maintained
- Full depth: Hip crease below top of knee
- Drive through heels to stand

**Common Faults:**

- Knees caving inward (valgus)
- Weight shifting to toes
- Loss of lumbar curve (rounding)
- Incomplete depth

**Progression:**

- Master air squat before adding load
- Progress to front squat, then back squat
- Goblet squat as intermediate step

---

#### 2. Front Squat

Barbell positioned on front of shoulders.

**Setup:**

- Bar rests in "rack position" on shoulders
- Elbows high, upper arms parallel to ground
- Loose fingertip grip, full grip not required
- Same squatting mechanics as air squat

**Key Points:**

- Torso more upright than back squat
- Core engagement critical
- Teaches proper receiving position for clean

**Scaling:**

- Use PVC or empty barbell initially
- Focus on rack position and elbow height
- Add weight only with proper mechanics

---

#### 3. Back Squat

Barbell positioned on back of shoulders.

**Setup:**

- Low bar: Across rear delts, below spine of scapula
- High bar: On top of traps
- Hands outside shoulders, squeeze shoulder blades
- Bar path straight down and up

**Advantages:**

- Allows heaviest loads
- Develops posterior chain
- Foundation for strength development

**Safety:**

- Use spotters or rack for heavy lifts
- Ensure proper depth
- Maintain neutral spine throughout

---

### Hip and Posterior Chain

#### 4. Deadlift

Lifting object from ground to standing position.

**Setup:**

- Stance: Hip width, toes slightly out
- Grip: Just outside legs
- Shins vertical, touching bar
- Shoulders over or slightly in front of bar
- Lumbar curve locked in (neutral spine)
- Chest up, eyes forward

**Execution:**

- Push floor away with legs
- Keep bar close to body
- Hips and shoulders rise at same rate
- Full hip extension at top
- Lower with same mechanics in reverse

**Common Errors:**

- Rounding back (dangerous)
- Bar drifting away from body
- Incomplete hip extension
- Dropping the bar (lose eccentric training)

---

#### 5. Sumo Deadlift High Pull (SDHP)

Explosive posterior chain and upper body pulling.

**Setup:**

- Wide stance (sumo)
- Hands inside legs, narrow grip
- Same starting position as deadlift

**Execution:**

- Explosive hip extension
- Shrug shoulders up
- Pull bar to chin/chest level
- Elbows high and outside
- Lower with control

**Purpose:**

- Develops explosive power
- Trains triple extension (ankles, knees, hips)
- Functional pulling pattern

---

#### 6. Medicine Ball Clean

Teaching tool for Olympic lifting movements.

**Execution:**

- Squat down, pick up medicine ball
- Explosive hip extension
- Receive ball on shoulders in front squat
- Stand to full extension

**Benefits:**

- Safe introduction to explosive movements
- Develops coordination and timing
- Scalable for all levels

---

### Pressing Movements

#### 7. Shoulder Press (Strict Press)

Vertical pressing with no leg drive.

**Setup:**

- Bar in front rack position
- Hands just outside shoulders
- Feet hip width
- Core tight, squeeze glutes

**Execution:**

- Press bar straight up
- Move head back slightly to clear bar path
- Lock out overhead, active shoulders
- Bar stacks over midfoot at top
- Lower with control to start position

**Key Points:**

- No leg drive (strict)
- Full lockout overhead
- Maintain midline stability

---

#### 8. Push Press

Pressing with leg drive assistance.

**Difference from Shoulder Press:**

- Includes "dip and drive" with legs
- Allows heavier loads
- More power development

**Execution:**

- Start same as shoulder press
- Small dip (4-6 inches)
- Explosive drive through legs
- Press arms to lockout
- Receive with active shoulders

**Dip Mechanics:**

- Vertical torso (don't lean forward)
- Hips and knees bend together
- Heels stay down
- Fast, explosive drive

---

#### 9. Push Jerk

Most powerful overhead movement.

**Additional Component:**

- Drop under bar (re-bend legs)
- Receive in partial squat
- Stand to complete rep

**Execution:**

- Same dip and drive as push press
- Aggressive press with arms
- Drop under bar simultaneously
- Receive in partial squat
- Stand with bar overhead

**Benefits:**

- Allows heaviest overhead loads
- Most functional overhead pattern
- Develops speed and coordination

---

## Programming Principles

### Workout of the Day (WOD) Structure

**Typical Session Format (60 minutes):**

1. **Warm-up (10-15 minutes)**

   - General: Elevate heart rate, movement prep
   - Specific: Movements related to WOD

2. **Skill/Strength Work (15-20 minutes)**

   - Technical practice
   - Strength development
   - Low rep, high quality

3. **Workout of the Day (10-20 minutes)**

   - High intensity
   - Varied stimulus
   - Measurable and repeatable

4. **Cool-down (5-10 minutes)**
   - Stretching
   - Mobility work
   - Active recovery

---

### Common WOD Formats

#### AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible)

- Fixed time limit (commonly 10, 15, 20 minutes)
- Complete as many rounds + reps as possible
- Score: Total rounds and reps

**Example:**

```
20-Minute AMRAP:
5 Pull-ups
10 Push-ups
15 Air Squats
```

---

#### For Time

- Fixed work, complete as fast as possible
- Score: Time to completion
- Cap time often included

**Example:**

```
For Time (20-minute cap):
21-15-9 reps of:
Thrusters (95/65 lbs)
Pull-ups
```

---

#### EMOM (Every Minute On the Minute)

- Prescribed work at start of each minute
- Rest remaining time in minute
- Duration: typically 10-30 minutes

**Example:**

```
12-Minute EMOM:
Minute 1: 15 Wall Balls
Minute 2: 12 Burpees
Minute 3: 9 Box Jumps
(Repeat 4 rounds)
```

---

#### Chipper

- Long list of movements
- Complete once through
- No rounds, just work through list

**Example:**

```
For Time:
50 Double-unders
40 Sit-ups
30 Kettlebell Swings
20 Box Jumps
10 Burpees
```

---

#### Tabata

- 20 seconds work, 10 seconds rest
- 8 rounds (4 minutes total per movement)
- Score: Lowest round or total reps

**Example:**

```
Tabata Air Squats
(8 rounds: 20 sec work / 10 sec rest)
```

## Scaling Philosophy

### The Art of Scaling

**Core Principle:** Preserve intended stimulus while making workout accessible.

**Three Scaling Dimensions:**

1. **Load (Weight)**

   - Reduce barbell weight
   - Use lighter dumbbells/kettlebells
   - Bodyweight instead of loaded

2. **Volume (Reps/Rounds)**

   - Fewer rounds or reps
   - Shorter time domains
   - Reduced movement quantity

3. **Complexity (Movement)**
   - Substitute simpler movement
   - Use assistance (bands, boxes)
   - Modify range of motion

**Scaling Examples:**

**Pull-ups:**

- Strict pull-ups (advanced)
- Jumping pull-ups (intermediate)
- Ring rows (beginner)
- Banded pull-ups (assistance)

**Box Jumps:**

- 30" box (advanced males)
- 24" box (intermediate males)
- 20" box (beginner males)
- Step-ups (scaling for safety/skill)

**Double-unders:**

- Double-unders (as prescribed)
- Single-unders x3 (common scale)
- Practice attempts + singles (skill work)

## Nutrition Guidelines (CrossFit Foundation)

### Base Prescription

**World-Class Fitness in 100 Words:**

> "Eat meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, and no sugar. Keep intake to levels that will support exercise but not body fat. Practice and train major lifts: Deadlift, clean, squat, presses, C&J, and snatch. Similarly, master the basics of gymnastics: pull-ups, dips, rope climb, push-ups, sit-ups, presses to handstand, pirouettes, flips, splits, and holds. Bike, run, swim, row, etc., hard and fast. Five or six days per week, mix these elements in as many combinations and patterns as creativity will allow. Routine is the enemy. Keep workouts short and intense. Regularly learn and play new sports."

### Practical Nutrition Guidelines

**Macronutrient Balance:**

- Protein: 30% (lean meats, fish, eggs)
- Carbohydrates: 40% (vegetables, fruits, some starches)
- Fat: 30% (nuts, oils, avocados)

**Quality Priorities:**

1. Whole, unprocessed foods
2. Adequate protein for recovery
3. Carbohydrates around training
4. Healthy fats for hormone function
5. Hydration throughout day

**The CrossFit/Zone/Paleo Approach:**

- Zone Diet: Macronutrient portioning (blocks system)
- Paleo: Food quality (ancestral foods)
- Combined: Quality portions for optimal performance

---

## Common Injury Prevention

### Fundamental Principles

1. **Mechanics → Consistency → Intensity**

   - Perfect form before adding load
   - Consistency in quality movement
   - Only then increase intensity

2. **Scale Appropriately**

   - Ego is the enemy
   - Every workout can be scaled
   - No shame in appropriate modification

3. **Listen to Your Body**
   - Pain is different from discomfort
   - Sharp pain = stop immediately
   - Soreness is normal, joint pain is not

### Common Issues and Prevention

**Lower Back Strain:**

- Maintain neutral spine in all lifts
- Strengthen core progressively
- Don't exceed technical capability
- Use proper warm-up protocols

**Shoulder Overuse:**

- Balance pushing and pulling volumes
- Develop scapular stability
- Scale kipping movements appropriately
- Adequate rest between sessions

**Knee Issues:**

- Proper squat mechanics (knees tracking toes)
- Build capacity gradually
- Address mobility limitations
- Use appropriate box heights

**Metabolic Overdoing:**

- Rhabdomyolysis risk with extreme workouts
- Build capacity progressively
- Stay hydrated
- Recognize warning signs (dark urine, excessive soreness)

---

## Recovery and Lifestyle

### Sleep

- 8-9 hours nightly for optimal recovery
- Consistent sleep schedule
- Quality sleep environment
- Prioritize over extra training

### Active Recovery

- Light movement on rest days
- Walking, easy swimming, cycling
- Yoga or mobility work
- Keeps blood flowing without taxing system

### Mobility Work

- Daily practice recommended
- Focus on movement limitations
- Use tools: foam roller, lacrosse ball
- Address specific restriction areas

### Stress Management

- Training is physical stress
- Manage life stress for recovery
- Mental health supports physical performance
- Balance training with other life demands
